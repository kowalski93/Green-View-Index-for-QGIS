This plugin aims to popularize the Green View Index (GVI) as a measurement of urban green among researchers and planners who are not too confident with code. 
It consists of three tools:
1. Generate Sample Points: Creates random points within an area. Those points can be used as input in the next tools
2. Download Google Street View Images: For a point dataset, downloads street view locations with parameters given by the user (such as fov, size and direction angles)
3. Calculate Green View Index: For the images downloaded by the previous tool, the vegetation pixels are extracted and the Green View Index of its point is calculated

Full documentaion can be found in the pdf document of this repository.
